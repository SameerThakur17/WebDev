    Flexbox
        It deals with the alignment of the elements inside a parent element.
        1.Main Axis 
            The axis or direction in which the flex items are aligned is called main axis
        2.Cross Axis
            The axis or the direction perpendicular to the main axis or direction is called cross axis.
        3.Start and End terminal define the starting and ending point for alignment of the flex items.
            start and end points could be reversed

    Flex Properties
        1.display:flex
            To set the display of an element to flex
            This property is applied to the parent element or flex container
        
        2.flex-direction
            To specify the flex direction
            This property is applied to the parent element or flex container
            flex-direction:x;
            x -> row(default),column,row-reverse and column-reverse

        3.flex-basis
            ->It is applied to flex items
            ->It is used to define the size of the item along the main axis
                ->The scenario in which flex-direction is row or row-reverse flex basis defines the width of the flex-item
                ->The scenario in which flex-direction is column or column-reverse flex basis defines the height of the flex-item
            ->The default value is auto.
            ->The length value (of flex basis) overrides the width property even if explicitly defined.
            ->if the flex-basis:auto and width:auto then the value defined in width property is considered
        
        4.flex-grow
            1.It is applicable to flex items
            2.Only applicable if the container has avialble space after placing all the flex items.
            3.Its default value is 0
            4.It causes an item to stretch beyond its specified width in proprtion to other flex items as per their flex-grow values.
        
        5.flex-shrink
            1.It is applicable to flex items
            2.Only applicable if the container has deficit space.
            3.Its default value is 1
            4.It causes an item to shrink beyond its specified width in proprtion to other flex items as per their flex-shrink values.

        6.flex shorthand
            flex:flex-flow flex-shrink flex-basis;
            
        7.flex-wrap
            ->It is applied to the flex container.
            ->It is applied only if the container has deficit space.
            ->It allows the browser to wrap the items together in another line instead of shrinking to fit in the same line.
            ->It has two values:wrap and nowrap(default)
            ->The flex shrink property does not affect the flex items if flex-wrap property is set to wrap.

        8.flex-flow
            It is applied to flex-container.
            flex-flow:flex-direction flex-wrap;
        
        9.justify-content
            It is applied to the flex container.
            It is applied only if the container has vailable space.
            It tells browser how the available space should be distributed along the main-axis,across the items.
            It works only if none of the flex items are allowed to grow.
            It has 6 values:flex-start(default), flex-end , center ,space-around, space-between and space evenly.

        10.align-items
            It is applied to the flex container.
            It tells the browser how the items should be laid out along the cross axis.
            It has four values:stretch(default),flex-start ,flex-end and center.
        
        11.self-align
            It is applied to individual flex-items.
            It has 4 values :stretch(default),flex-start,flex-end and center.
