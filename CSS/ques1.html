<!-- Before we proceed to the next topic, here is one exercise that you need to complete on your own. The guided steps are mentioned that you need to follow and make sure that you complete this exercise as it will play an important role while developing the website as a part of the last module.

Create a folder named "project" inside C:\xampp\htdocs (Windows users); /var/www/html/ (Linux users).
Create folders named, "img", "css" and "js" inside the "project" folder.
Create a file named "home.html" inside the project folder with the following content:
<html>
    <head>
        <title>CSS Page</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is a heading.</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>
Create a file named "style.css" inside the "css" folder with the following content:
h1 {
    color: green; 
    background-color: yellow; 
    font-size: 24px;
}
p {
    color: red; 
    background-color: skyblue; 
    font-size: 14px;
}
Now open the home.html file in your browser using the 127.0.0.1 url and see if the page is being styled properly.
Try to observe in detail what is happening. -->
