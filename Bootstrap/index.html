    BOOTSTRAP
        ->CSS Library with some pre-written CSS code.
        ->* always link the custom CSS file after linking the pre-written bootstrap file to override any pre-defined property accordingly.

        -Bootstrap has a 12 grid structure
            col-n(n=1 to 12)
                this means than the column will occupy n/12 % portion (or n portions from 12) of the complete width of the row.
            
                1.col-2 + col-6 + col-4 ->sum of n =12 ie this will occupy complete width of the parent element(class row).

                2.if sum of all the cols(with n) is greater than 12 then the flex-items are wrapped in the next line.

                3.if sum of all the cols(with n) is lesser than 12 then the remaining width stays as it is.

                col-auto
                    the columm takes only the required width
                col
                    the column covers all the remaining width

    -Breakpoints in bootstrap

            Device            |  Range     |   Symbol  |   Breakpoint   
        Mobile device         |  0-575     |           |      >=0
        Mobile landscape      |  576-767   |     sm    |      >=576
            Tablet            |  768-991   |     md    |      >=768
            Desktop           |  992-1199  |     lg    |      >=992
        Extra large desktop   |  1200-1399 |     xl    |      >=1200
    Extra extra large desktop |  1400-     |     xxl   |      >=1400

    -> T he breakpoint is always used in between 'col' and 'n'
        eg-> col-md-5
    -> It is used to specify after which point the column will be sized accordingly. 
    -> The size of the column will be 5/12 for viewport >= 768 pixels.
    -> Bootstrap follows bottoms-up approach and mobile first approach.
